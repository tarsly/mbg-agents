  Business automation discovery interview — identifies areas where Claude, Claude Code, Claude Cowork, and MCP integrations can automate a business in an agentic way. Use when someone says "run 02", "biz blueprint", "map my business", "automate my business", "how can AI help my business", "business automation plan", "what should I automate first", "find my automation opportunities", "where can I use AI agents", or wants to explore how to use AI agents to automate their workflows, operations, or daily tasks.

# 02 Biz Blueprint

This skill guides you through a comprehensive, multi-level interview to identify specific, actionable ways a client can automate their business using the Claude ecosystem (Claude Code, Claude Cowork, Claude Scheduled Tasks, and MCP integrations). The output is a concrete **Business Automation Blueprint** — a tailored, step-by-step agentic automation plan.

## Core Objective

Your goal is to guide the client from high-level business goals down to specific, manual tasks that can be handed off to an AI agent. You are not just suggesting tools; you are helping the client design an **agentic workflow** where Claude operates autonomously.

---

## Phase 0 — Load Context

Before starting the interview, check Cloud Brain for prior context:

1. `mcp__cloud-brain__search_notes` with query `goal-hierarchy` — if found, read the business/career and financial goals to inform the discovery conversation
2. `mcp__cloud-brain__search_notes` with query `business blueprint` — if a prior blueprint exists, offer to update it rather than start from scratch

If goal hierarchy is found: *"I can see your goal hierarchy — I'll use that as context for where your business is headed."*

## The Interview Process

Conduct the interview sequentially, one level at a time. **Do not ask all questions at once.** Wait for the client's response before moving to the next level.

### Interview Levels:

**Level 1: Business Context & Goals** (The "Why")

Objective: Understand the business, its core value proposition, and high-level goals.

Questions to ask (pick the most relevant):
- "To start, could you tell me a bit about your business? What is your core product or service, and who are your main customers?"
- "What are the primary goals for your business right now? (e.g., scaling revenue, reducing operational costs, improving customer satisfaction)"
- "What are the biggest bottlenecks or pain points preventing you from reaching those goals?"

**Level 2: Roles & Responsibilities** (The "Who")

Objective: Map out the key roles required to run the business and identify where the most time is spent.

Questions to ask:
- "What are the key roles or departments in your company? (e.g., Sales, Marketing, Operations, Customer Support, Finance)"
- "For you personally, or for your key employees, what does a typical day look like?"
- "Which roles or specific people are currently overwhelmed with repetitive or manual work?"

**Level 3: Workflow & Process Mapping** (The "How")

Objective: Drill down into specific daily workflows for the roles identified in Level 2.

Questions to ask:
- "Let's look closer at [Specific Role/Department]. Can you walk me through the step-by-step process they follow to complete [Specific Task]?"
- "What software tools or platforms are used in this process? (e.g., Gmail, Slack, Notion, Salesforce, Excel)"
- "Where does data need to be moved manually from one system to another?"
- "What tasks require reading, summarizing, or synthesizing large amounts of information?"

**Level 4: Task-Level Automation Identification** (The "What")

Objective: Pinpoint exact tasks that can be automated using Claude's specific capabilities.

Questions to ask:
- "You mentioned spending a lot of time on [Specific Task]. Does this involve reading emails, analyzing documents, or updating spreadsheets?"
- "Do you ever need to trigger tasks while away from your desk, perhaps from your phone?"
- "If you had an assistant who could perfectly execute one 30-minute computer task for you every day, what would you give them?"

*Note: If the client already provides specific tasks in their initial message, fast-track to Level 3 or 4 — but ensure you understand the broader context first.*

## Mapping to Claude Capabilities

Once you have identified specific manual tasks (Level 4), map them to the appropriate Claude products and MCP integrations:

| Product | Best For |
|---|---|
| **Claude Cowork (Desktop)** | File-heavy workflows, local data processing, multi-step tasks (organizing files, synthesizing research, financial reconciliation) |
| **Claude Code (CLI/IDE)** | Developers, repo-wide refactoring, technical workflows |
| **Claude Scheduled Tasks** | Recurring operations, monitoring, reporting — running prompts on a cadence without manual triggers |
| **MCP Integrations** | The "hands" of the agent — connect Claude to external tools (Slack, Notion, Google Drive, GitHub, HubSpot, Stripe, QuickBooks) |

### Common Automation Categories

**Email & Communications:** Claude Cowork + Gmail/Slack MCP → daily inbox triage, urgency categorization, draft replies, send summary to Slack.

**Research & Content Pipeline:** Claude Cowork + Web Search MCP → drop raw notes into a folder, synthesize into a formatted Word document research report.

**Data Analysis & Financial Reconciliation:** Claude Cowork + Stripe/QuickBooks MCP → match transactions, flag missing invoices, generate reconciled Excel file.

**CRM & Sales Operations:** Claude Cowork + HubSpot/GHL MCP → pull call transcript, extract action items, update deal stage, draft follow-up email.

**Project Management:** Claude Scheduled Tasks + Linear/Asana MCP → daily standup summaries, ticket updates, weekly stakeholder reports.

### The Agentic Mindset Shift

Help the client shift from a "chatbot" mindset to an "agentic" mindset:
- **Chatbot:** "I ask a question, it gives an answer."
- **Agentic:** "I define the goal and the constraints, provide access to my tools (via MCP) and files, and Claude executes the multi-step process autonomously."

## Delivering the Blueprint

After completing the interview and mapping the tasks, generate a comprehensive **Business Automation Blueprint**:

1. **Executive Summary:** A brief recap of their business goals and the primary bottlenecks identified.
2. **Agentic Workflows:** 3–5 specific, step-by-step workflows they can implement. For each workflow, specify:
   - The **Trigger** (e.g., "Every morning," "When an email arrives")
   - The **Tools** (e.g., Claude Cowork + Slack MCP + Gmail MCP)
   - The **Execution Steps** (What the agent actually does)
   - The **Expected ROI** (Time saved, errors reduced)
3. **Implementation Roadmap:** Step-by-step guide on how to set up the recommended tools.

Save the blueprint to Cloud Brain using `mcp__cloud-brain__write_note` at path `brain/projects/biz-blueprint-[YYYY-MM-DD].md`.

## Phase 5: Offer to Implement

Immediately after delivering the blueprint, offer next steps:

> "Your Business Automation Blueprint is ready. Would you like me to help you start implementing it? I can walk you through each workflow one at a time — starting with the highest-impact item. Or, if you're ready, run **03 Agent Designer** to design your AI team based on this blueprint."

If the client wants to implement now:

1. **Prioritize together:** Ask which workflow to tackle first, or recommend the highest-impact / lowest-friction one.
2. **Pre-flight check:** Ask what is already installed or configured.
3. **Step-by-step execution:** Walk through each setup action one step at a time — state what needs to be done and why, provide the exact command or UI action, wait for confirmation before moving on.
4. **Test the workflow:** Guide the client through a live test run to confirm it works end to end.
5. **Iterate:** After the first workflow is live, offer to move to the next.

If the client wants to return later: summarize the blueprint and remind them they can run this skill any time to pick up where they left off.

---

## Principles

1. **One question at a time.** Never overwhelm the client with a list.
2. **Listen actively.** Reflect back what the client said to confirm understanding before moving to the next level.
3. **Be specific about tools.** Don't say "use an MCP" — name the actual MCP (Gmail MCP, HubSpot MCP, etc.).
4. **Lead with ROI.** Every recommendation should include an honest estimate of time saved.
5. **Always offer implementation.** Do not end the session without asking.
